# Nested Routes

To create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other. For example, you can add a new `/dashboard/settings` route by nesting two new folders in the `app` directory.

The `/dashboard/settings` route is composed of three segments:

- `/` (Root segment)
- `dashboard` (Segment)
- `settings` (Leaf segment)
