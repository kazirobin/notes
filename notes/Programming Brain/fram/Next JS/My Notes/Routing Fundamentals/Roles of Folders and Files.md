# Roles of Folders and Files

Next.js uses a file-system based router where:

• **Folders** are used to define routes. A route is a single path of nested folders, following the file-system hierarchy from the **root folder** down to a final **leaf folder** that includes a `page.js` file. See Defining Routes.
• **Files** are used to create UI that is shown for a route segment.
