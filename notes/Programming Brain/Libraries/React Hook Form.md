# React Hook Form

Most applications have forms to collect data. Depending on the use case, implementing forms can be pretty complex, especially when building enterprise-level applications that provide an intuitive and flawless user experience. As a developer, you have likely stumbled across building forms in most of your projects. Of course, you can manage simple forms on your own, but after a point, it becomes sensible to use a library that abstracts a lot of work in handling complex forms.
