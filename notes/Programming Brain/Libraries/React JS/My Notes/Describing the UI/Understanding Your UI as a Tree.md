Your React app is taking shape with many components being nested within each other. How does React keep track of your appâ€™s component structure?

React, and many other UI libraries, model UI as a tree. Thinking of your app as a tree is useful for understanding the relationship between components. This understanding will help you debug future concepts like performance and state management.
