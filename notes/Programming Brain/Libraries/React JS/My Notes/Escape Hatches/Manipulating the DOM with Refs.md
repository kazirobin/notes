# Manipulating the DOM with Refs

React automatically updates the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) to match your render output, so your components won’t often need to manipulate it. However, sometimes you might need access to the DOM elements managed by React—for example, to focus a node, scroll to it, or measure its size and position. There is no built-in way to do those things in React, so you will need a *ref* to the DOM node.
