# Winston

Winston  is the most popular logging library for Node.js. It aims to make logging more flexible and extensible by decoupling different aspects such as log levels, formatting, and storage so that each API is independent and many combinations are supported. It also uses Node.js streams  to minimize the performance impact of implementing logging in your application.
