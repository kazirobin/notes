# Libraries

A web library is a collection of reusable code that provides specific functionality or features for web applications. Unlike a web framework, which is a more comprehensive and structured set of tools and conventions that define the architecture and logic of a web application, a web library is more flexible and modular, allowing you to choose and combine the components that suit your needs.
