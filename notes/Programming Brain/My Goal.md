# My Goal

My goal is to be a full-stack developer who works on the user interface, databases, servers, and everything. This allows them to create fully functional, scalable web applications independently or as part of a larger development team. I also want to be a cross-platform mobile app developer making Android and IOS apps.

My primary focus is on mastering JavaScript and Python, as these are versatile and powerful programming languages widely used in both web and mobile app development. JavaScript excels in creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Together, these languages form a comprehensive toolkit for building full-stack applications and mobile apps, aligning perfectly with my goal of becoming proficient in both domains.

## Frontend

Frontend development creates the visual and interactive parts of a website or web application that users interact with directly. It involves designing and coding everything a user sees and experiences in their browser, ensuring a smooth, responsive, and engaging user interface (UI).

- **Language:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Library:** ReactJS, jQuery
- **Framework:** NextJS, Remix

## Mobile App

Mobile app development is creating software applications specifically designed to run on mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. These apps can be built for different platforms, such as Android, iOS, or both, and are crafted to provide a seamless, user-friendly experience tailored to the unique features of mobile devices (e.g., touchscreens, sensors, GPS).

- **Language:**
- **Library:**
- **Framework:**

## Backend

Backend development refers to the server side of web development, focusing on the systems, databases, and applications that power the functionalities of a website or app. It ensures that the data and business logic required for the front end (what users see) work seamlessly behind the scenes. Backend developers create the backbone of web applications, making sure everything runs smoothly, securely, and efficiently.

- **Language:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python
- **Library:**
- **Framework:** NodeJS, Django, ExpressJS
- **API:** RestAPIs, GraphQL

## Database

A database is an organized collection of data that is stored, managed, and accessed electronically. Databases allow you to efficiently store large amounts of information, retrieve specific data when needed, and perform operations like updating or deleting records. They are essential components in applications, helping store and manage data such as user profiles, transactions, or product inventories.

- **Language:** SQL
- **SQL Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **NoSQL Database:** MongoDB
- **ORM & ODM:** Mongoose, Prisma, Drizzle

## DevOps

DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and cultural philosophies that help software development and IT teams work together. The goal of DevOps is to improve the speed and quality of software delivery by breaking down silos between development and operations teams.

- **CI/CD:** Github Action, Jenkins
- **Testing:**
- **Automation:** Kubernetes, Docker Compose
- **Cloud Server:** AWS,
- **Containerization:** Docker
