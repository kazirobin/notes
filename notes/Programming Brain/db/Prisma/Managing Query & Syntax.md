# Managing Query & Syntax

Prisma is an open-source database toolkit that simplifies database access and management. It provides a type-safe and auto-completing API for interacting with databases in a way that's both efficient and developer-friendly. Prisma queries refer to the way you interact with your database using Prisma's query language and client.
