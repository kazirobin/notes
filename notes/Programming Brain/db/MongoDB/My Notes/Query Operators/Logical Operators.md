# Logical Operators

**Logical query operators** in **MongoDB** are fundamental tools used to combine or modify the results of queries using logical conditions. These operators empower developers to create complex queries by combining multiple conditions and enabling precise filtering of documents based on various criteria.

| **Operator** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `$and` | It Joins query clauses with a logical AND. Returns documents that match all the conditions. |
| `$or` | Returns documents where either query matches |
| `$nor` | It Joins query clauses with a logical NOR. Returns documents that fail to match all the conditions. |
| `$not` | It Inverts the effect of a query expression. Returns documents that do not match the query expression. |
