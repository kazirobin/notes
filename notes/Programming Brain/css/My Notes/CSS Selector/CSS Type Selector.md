# CSS Type Selector

The CSS type selector selects all HTML elements of the specified type. To use it, mention the name of the HTML element.

For example, if you wanted to apply a style to every single paragraph in the HTML document, you would specify the `p` element:

```css
p {
    property: value;
}
```

The code above matches and selects all `p` elements within the document and styles them.
