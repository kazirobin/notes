# CSS Selector

Specifically, CSS selectors allow you to select multiple elements at once.

They are helpful when you want to apply the same styles to more than one HTML element, because you will not repeat yourself by writing the same lines of code for different elements.

CSS selectors are also helpful when you want to make a change - you only need to make the change in one place, which saves you a lot of time.

CSS selectors are among the first things you need to learn when you first start writing CSS code. And there are many selectors available to choose from, along with several different ways to use them - more than you may realize.

## Simple CSS Selectors

Selectors allow you to target and select specific parts of your document for styling purposes.

Simple selectors directly select one or more elements:

- By using the universal selector,Â `*`
- Based on the name/type of the element.
- Based on the class value of the element.
- Based on the ID value of the element.

By learning how the most simple selectors work, you can understand how to use the more complex ones.
