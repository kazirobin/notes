# RGB Format

`RGB` format is the short form of '`RED GREEN` and `BLUE`' that is used for defining the color of an HTML element simply by specifying the values of `R, G, B` that are in the range of `0` to `255`.

The color values in this format are specified by using the `rgb()` property. This property allows three values that can either be in percentage or integer (range from `0` to `255`).

This property is not supported in all browsers; that's why it is not recommended to use it.

### Syntax

```css
color: rgb(R, G, B);
```
