# HSLA

It is entirely similar to HSL property, except that it contains `A (alpha)` that specifies the element's transparency. The value of alpha is in the range `0.0` ****to ****`1.0`, in which `0.0` indicates fully transparent, and `1.0` indicates not transparent.

### Syntax

```css
color:hsla(H, S, L, A);
```
