# HSL

It is a short form of **Hue, Saturation,** and **Lightness**. Let's understand them individually.

**Hue:** It can be defined as the degree on the color wheel from `0` to `360. 0` represents red, `120` represents green, `240` represents blue.

**Saturation:** It takes value in percentage in which `100%` represents fully saturated, i.e., no shades of gray, `50%` represent `50%` gray, but the color is still visible, and `0%` represents fully unsaturated, i.e., completely gray, and the color is invisible.

**Lightness:** The lightness of the color can be defined as the light that we want to provide the color in which `0%` represents black (there is no light), `50%` represents neither dark nor light, and `100%` represents white (full lightness).

Let's see the syntax of HSL in color property.

### Syntax

```css
color:hsl(H, S, L);
