# Docker CLI

A cheatsheet is a concise summary of important information that is meant to be used as a quick reference. Cheatsheets are often used in the form of a list or a table, and they typically cover a specific topic or subject area. In the context of Docker, a Docker cheatsheet is a summary of commonly used Docker commands and their options, as well as other useful information related to Docker.

---

## General Commands

- **`docker --version`**: Displays the current version of Docker installed on your machine, including the build number. Useful for verifying compatibility with features and commands.
- **`docker info`** : Provides detailed information about the Docker installation, including the number of containers, images, and volumes, as well as the storage driver in use.

## Image Commands

- `docker pull <image>`: Downloads a specified Docker image from a remote registry (like Docker Hub) to your local machine. If no tag is specified, it pulls the `latest` version by default.
- `docker push <image>`: Uploads a local Docker image to a remote registry. The image must be tagged appropriately to match the repository structure.
- `docker images`: Lists all Docker images on your local machine, displaying details like repository, tag, image ID, creation date, and size.
- `docker rmi <image>`: Removes one or more specified images from your local Docker storage. Cannot remove an image that is currently in use by a running container unless you use the `--force` option.
- `docker tag <source-image> <target-image>`: Creates a new tag for an existing image, allowing it to be referenced by a different name or version. Useful for versioning images.
- `docker build -t <name>:<tag> <path>`: Builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile located at the specified path. The `-t` option allows you to tag the image with a name and optional tag.

## Container Commands

- `docker run <options> <image>`: Creates and starts a container from the specified image. Options can include `-d` (detached mode), `-p` (port mapping), `--name` (assigning a name), and environment variables.
- `docker ps`: Lists all currently running containers, showing their IDs, names, status, and other relevant information.
- `docker ps -a`: Lists all containers, including those that are stopped. This helps you see both active and inactive containers.
- `docker stop <container>`: Stops a running container gracefully, allowing it to complete ongoing processes before termination.
- `docker start <container>`: Starts a previously stopped container, restoring its previous state.
- `docker restart <container>`: Stops and then starts a container, which is useful for applying configuration changes without removing the container.
- `docker exec -it <container> <command>`: Executes a specified command inside a running container. The `-it` option provides an interactive terminal, enabling real-time interaction.
- `docker logs <container>`: Displays the logs produced by a container, helping with debugging and monitoring the application's output.
- `docker rm <container>`: Removes one or more stopped containers. Running containers must be stopped before removal.

## Volume Commands

- `docker volume ls`: Lists all Docker volumes on your local machine. Volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers.
- `docker volume create <volume>`: Creates a new Docker volume for persistent storage. Volumes are managed by Docker and can be shared among containers.
- `docker volume rm <volume>`: Removes one or more specified volumes. Only unused volumes can be removed.
- `docker volume inspect <volume>`: Displays detailed information about a specified volume, including its mount point and options.

## Network Commands

- `docker network ls`: Lists all Docker networks available on your system. Networking is crucial for inter-container communication.
- `docker network create <network>`: Creates a new Docker network, allowing containers to communicate with each other using this network.
- `docker network rm <network>`: Removes one or more specified networks. A network can only be removed if no containers are using it.
- `docker network inspect <network>`: Displays detailed information about a specified network, including connected containers and configuration settings.

## Docker Compose Commands

- `docker-compose up`: Starts all the services defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file. This command builds images as necessary and starts containers for each service.
- `docker-compose down`: Stops and removes all containers, networks, and volumes defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file. This cleans up resources created by `docker-compose up`.
- `docker-compose build`: Builds images for services defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file, using the specified build context and Dockerfile.
- `docker-compose logs`: Displays the logs for services defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file, allowing you to view output from multiple containers in one place.

## Swarm Commands

- `docker swarm init`: Initializes a new Swarm cluster, making the current Docker node a manager. This allows for service orchestration and scaling across multiple nodes.
- `docker swarm join`: Joins a new node to an existing Swarm cluster. This command is run on worker or manager nodes to integrate them into the Swarm.
- **`docker swarm leave`:** Removes the current node from the Swarm cluster. This can be used on both manager and worker nodes.
- **`docker service create <options>`:** Creates a new service in a Swarm, allowing you to run containers across multiple nodes for load balancing and high availability.
- **`docker service ls`**: Lists all services running in the current Swarm, showing details like ID, name, mode, and number of replicas.
- **`docker service rm <service>`:** Removes a specified service from the Swarm, terminating all associated containers.
- **`docker stack deploy`:** Deploys a stack defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file to the Swarm. This command manages multiple services as a single unit.

## Advanced Commands

- **`docker save -o <file>.tar <image>`:** Saves a specified Docker image to a tarball file, allowing for backup or transfer of the image to another system.
- **`docker load -i <file>.tar`:** Loads a Docker image from a tarball file into the local Docker repository, enabling the restoration of images from backups.
- **`docker prune`:** Removes all unused data, including stopped containers, unused networks, dangling images, and build cache, helping to free up disk space.

## Additional Commands

- **`docker attach <container>`:** Attaches to a running container's console, allowing you to interact with it directly.
- **`docker commit <container> <new-image>`:** Creates a new image from the changes made in a running container, capturing its current state.
- **`docker export <container> -o <file>.tar`:** Exports a container's filesystem as a tar archive, which can be useful for backup or transfer.
- **`docker import <file>.tar`:** Imports a tar archive to create a new filesystem image. This is useful for converting backups into images.
- **`docker diff <container>`:** Shows changes made to files or directories in a specified container since it was started, highlighting modified, added, or deleted files.
- **`docker cp <container>:<path> <local-path>`:** Copies files or folders between a container and the local filesystem. This can be used to transfer data in and out of containers.
- **`docker stats`:** Displays a live stream of resource usage statistics for running containers, including CPU, memory, network I/O, and block I/O.
