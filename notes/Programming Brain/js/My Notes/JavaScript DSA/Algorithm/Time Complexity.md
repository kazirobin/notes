# Time Complexity

Time complexity is a way to describe how the time it takes for a piece of code to run changes as the size of the input grows. It helps us understand how efficient or slow an algorithm is. Think of it as a way to estimate how much longer your code will take if you give it more data to work with.

## What is Big-O Notation

Big-O notation is a mathematical notation used in computer science to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's time or space complexity as a function of the input size. It provides a high-level understanding of the algorithm's efficiency by focusing on its growth rate relative to the input size, and it helps compare the performance of different algorithms.

Here's a breakdown of Big-O notation:

### Key Concepts

- Growth Rate: Big-O notation describes how the running time or space requirements of an algorithm increase as the input size `ùëõ` grows. It emphasizes the dominant term of the growth rate and ignores constants and lower-order terms, which are less significant for large inputs.
- Upper Bound: Big-O provides an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm. It guarantees that the algorithm will not grow faster than the specified function as the input size increases.

## Type of Time Complexity

In computer science, time complexity is a way to describe the amount of computational time that an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of the input. Here are some common types of time complexity:

- Constant Time (O(1))
- Logarithmic Time (O(log n)
- Linear Time (O(n))
- Linearithmic Time (O(n log n))
- Quadratic Time (O(n^2))
- Cubic Time (O(n^3))
- Exponential Time (O(2^n))
- Factorial Time (O(n!))

Understanding time complexity helps in evaluating how well an algorithm will perform as the input size grows, and is crucial for designing efficient algorithms.
