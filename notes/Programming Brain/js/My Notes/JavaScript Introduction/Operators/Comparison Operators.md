# Comparison Operators

Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean value, either `true` or `false`.

```jsx
const a = 3, b = 2;
console.log(a > b); // true
```

Here, the comparison operator `>` is used to compare whether `a` is greater than `b`.

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| == | **Equal to**: returns `true` if the operands are equal | x  ==  y |
| ! = | **Not equal to**: returns `true` if the operands are not equal | x  ! =  y |
| === | **Strict equal to**: `true` if the operands are equal and of the same type | x  ===  y |
| ! = = | **Strict not equal to**: `true` if the operands are equal but of different type or not equal at all | x  ! ==  y |
| > | **Greater than**: `true` if left operand is greater than the right operand | x  >  y |
| > = | **Greater than or equal to**: `true` if left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand | x > = y |
| < | **Less than**: `true` if the left operand is less than the right operand | x < y |
| < = | **Less than or equal to**: `true` if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand | x < = y |
