# Abstraction

Abstraction means hiding certain details that don't matter to the user and only showing essential features or functions.

For example, take a cell phone. We don't show details like `verifyTemperature()`, `verifyVolt()`, `frontCamOn()`, `frontCamOff()` and so on. Instead we provide essential features which matter to user like camera(), volumeBtn(), and others.
