# String

JavaScript strings are the sequence of characters. In JavaScript, strings automatically convert the string to objects so that we can use string methods and properties also for primitive strings. It is used to represent and manipulate the sequence of characters.

In general, there are two ways to create a string in JavaScript. Either by using the new String() syntax or putting the value in quotes.

This example creates a string in JavaScript using the methods described above.

```jsx
let str1 = "I Love JavaScript";
let str2 = new String("I Love JavaScript");
```

## String Methods and Property

String methods and properties are important to perform any operation on the given string, String indexes start from 0. The first character is in position 0 and the second in 1 and the same follows. We can call any of the pre-defined methods of JavaScript as it automatically converts from string primitive to objects.

Some of the commonly used JavaScript string methods are:

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| length | The length property returns the length of a string. |
| charAt() | It provides the char value present at the specified index. |
| charCodeAt() | It provides the Unicode value of a character present at the specified index. |
| codePointAt() | It provides the Unicode value of a character present at the specified index. |
| concat() | It provides a combination of two or more strings. |
| indexOf() | It provides the position of a char value present in the given string. |
| lastIndexOf() | It provides the position of a char value present in the given string by searching a character from the last position. |
| search() | It searches a specified regular expression in a given string and returns its position if a match occurs. |
| match() | It searches a specified regular expression in a given string and returns that regular expression if a match occurs. |
| replace() | It replaces a given string with the specified replacement. |
| substr() | It is used to fetch the part of the given string on the basis of the specified starting position and length. |
| substring() | It is used to fetch the part of the given string on the basis of the specified index. |
| slice() | It is used to fetch the part of the given string. It allows us to assign positive as well negative index. |
| toLowerCase() | It converts the given string into lowercase letter. |
| toLocaleLowerCase() | It converts the given string into lowercase letter on the basis of host?s current locale. |
| toUpperCase() | It converts the given string into uppercase letter. |
| toLocaleUpperCase() | It converts the given string into uppercase letter on the basis of host?s current locale. |
| toString() | It provides a string representing the particular object. |
| valueOf() | It provides the primitive value of string object. |
| split() | It splits a string into substring array, then returns that newly created array. |
| trim() | It trims the white space from the left and right side of the string. |
