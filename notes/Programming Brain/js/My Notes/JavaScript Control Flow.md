# JavaScript Control Flow

Control flow is the order in which the JavaScript interpreter executes statements. If a script doesn't include statements that alter its flow, it's executed from beginning to end, one line at a time. Control structures are used to determine whether or not a set of statements are executed based on a defined set of criteria, execute a set of statements repeatedly, or interrupt a sequence of statements.
